      <h3 class="abouthead">Hi!<br> I'm Rebecca. </h3> <br>
      <p class="abouttext">I am a Junior in the School of Information studying User Experience. I am very interested as to how technology can change our lives for the better! I have done previous work in User Experience Research and look to pursue a career in the field after I graduate in May 2021.<br>
      <br>  Here are some fun facts about me. I have two cats named Chip and Dale. I am originally from New York and visit there for most holidays.  In my free time, I like to play volleyball, read, and hang out with friends. I am also a huge Michigan basketball fan and have gone to just about every game for the past two years I have been at the University.<br/>
      <br>This past spring break I went backpacking in Arizona. I had never been backpacking so it was definitely an experience I will never forget. The 30-hour car ride will also never be forgotten!! From this experience, I learned a lot about myself and was able to meet some pretty cool people in the process.<br>
