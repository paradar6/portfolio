      <h2>Books</h2>
      <p class= "textbox">I really enjoy reading (and even made a book club in high school!) but don’t have a lot of time to necessarily do it during the school year. I try my best but I find I am able to do the most reading either on breaks or during the summer. So here are some of the books I read this summer! I will update as time goes on but here are two good ones I have recently read to start!<br/>

<br/>The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn<br/>

<br/>I am excited because this book is being made into a movie in 2020. It is about a woman named Anna Fox who doesn’t leave her house. She always stares out the window and keeps tabs on the neighbors until one day she sees something she isn’t supposed to see. The reader can’t help bu wonder what is real and what is fake in this novel. It will truly keep you hooked until the last page.<br/>



<br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson<br/>

<br/>I have been meaning to read this book for a while. This psychological thriller is sure to keep you on your toes. It centers around Mikael Blomkvist, a publisher, who recently lost a libel case to a very rich man. Blomkvist is then approached by Henrik Vanger who wants to help Blomkvist get back at the rich man, but, in exchange, Vanger wants Blomkvist to investigate the whereabouts of his grandniece Harriet who disappeared a while before. In doing this, Vanger hires Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker, to look into Blomvist’s past. This book keeps the suspense throughout along with murder, romance, and mystery. A good read for anyone who is interested in murder mysteries.
