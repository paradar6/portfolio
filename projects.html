      <p class= "textbox2">The most recent project I have worked on was redesigning the website for the TEDx club at the University of Michigan. Before, the site was very plain and did not reflect all the cool things that TED did on campus and for the community. One of my club members and I took it upon ourselves to redesign this website in order to gain more traction and recruit more members. Our biggest issue we had to face was to ensure that if people went on the website to join and learn more about the club that it would be easily accessible for them. We did this by creating a running footer where prospective members could fill out the form and it would be sent to the TEDx email to get them on our distribution list. We found that this has been quite effective and has increased our membership this year so far.<p/>

          <a name="research"></a>
          <p class= "textbox2">This past school year I was on a team of 2 other undergraduates and one PhD student doing User Experience Research. Here we were tasked with qualitatively annotating screen recordings where data scientists were collaborating on a data science project. Our job was to document what the data scientists were doing in the document and everytime they changed tasks, we would also document that. From this research, the PhD student wanted to try to make a feature of a chatbox on Jupyter Notebooks so that data scientists could collaborate easier. <p/>

          <p class= "textbox2">  My freshman year I took a class for 3 weeks in the springtime called User Experience Research in the Public Sector. In this class, we met with the city of Ann Arbor to talk about their pain points regarding road closures due to special events and how information regarding them is disseminated to the public. My group was tasked with finding a way to make sure information could be available to residents in Ann Arbor through voice integration. After doing research in the field, making personas and prototypes, we came up with a suggestion. This would be based on the app Waze and when there was a road closure the app would alert the user through voice integrated technology.<br/>
